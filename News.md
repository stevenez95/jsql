Version **0.9** released.

Version **0.8.9** released.

Version **0.8.8** released.

Due to incompatibilities using maven release with git v1.8.5 I skipped version 0.8.7. So the actual released version is **0.8.8**.

Recent changes in **0.8.7-SNAPSHOT** for some alias support changes introducing some API changes.

Version **0.8.6** released.


The first release version **0.8.5** is available at maven central (**http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/**) and at repository 
**https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/**.


The maven repository settings have been changed. Version **0.8.5-SNAPSHOT** will be the
first snapshot at sonatypes open source repository location. The following releases will
go there as well and published to maven central. To avoid problems with the original 
projects artifacts the *groupid* was changed to **com.github.jsqlparser**. You will find
configuration details below.
